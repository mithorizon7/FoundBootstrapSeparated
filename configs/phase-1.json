Our primary goal is to analyze the landscape to identify the most promising core benefit for this new venture to build around.\n\nTASK\n\nProduce a structured report designed to guide a strategic decision on the company's core benefit. The report must contain the following five sections:\n\n1. Market Sizing & Growth\n\nCurrent‐year (e.g., Projected 2025) TAM and SAM in USD.\nRecent or Projected Market CAGR (specify timeframe, e.g., 2023-2028).\nMinimum one, preferably two, independent sources per figure (link or full citation). Prioritize reputable sources.\nBriefly outline key factors or common methodologies used to estimate potential SOM in this sector.\n2. Competitive Landscape: Strengths & Weaknesses\n\nIdentify the Top 5 competitors based on perceived market influence in the {{sector}}.\nFor each competitor, create a table with the following columns:\nBrand\nCore Offer\nKey Strengths (1-2 bullets)\nPerceived Weakness / Market Gap (1-2 bullets - e.g., high price, poor user experience, missing feature, underserved niche).\nMention any significant funding or M&A events in the last 18-24 months.\n3. Unmet Needs & Strategic Opportunities\n\nBased on your research, identify a minimum of three distinct Unmet Needs.\nFor each Unmet Need, present it as a strategic opportunity in a table with the following columns:\nIdentified Unmet Need: State the customer problem clearly and concisely.\nSupporting Evidence: Cite the specific data point, quote, or finding from your research that validates this need.\nStrategic Context: In 1-2 sentences, explain why this is a strong opportunity (e.g., \"This need is amplified by the macro trend of [Trend Name] and is a known weakness of Competitor X.\").\nSuggested Core Benefit: Propose a concise benefit that directly solves the Unmet Need (e.g., \"Effortless Meal Planning,\" \"Guilt-Free Creative Screen Time,\" \"Verifiable Skills for a Modern Workforce\").\n4. Macro & Regulatory Trends\n\nIdentify three trends (e.g., Technological, Regulatory, Economic, Social) most likely to significantly reshape this category within the next 3 years.\nPair each with a referenced statistic or forecast.\nFor each trend, briefly state its potential impact (opportunity or threat) on {{company_name}}.\n5. Synthesized Recommendation\n\nConclude the report with a brief summary (1-2 paragraphs).\nBased on the entire analysis, recommend which Suggested Core Benefit from Section 3 offers the most promising strategic path for {{company_name}}.\nJustify your recommendation by synthesizing insights from the competitive weaknesses, the scale of the unmet need, and alignment with macro trends.\nFORMAT\n\nReturn the content in GitHub-flavored Markdown with clear H2 headers for the numbered sections. Structure tables and lists cleanly for executive presentation. Finish with a consolidated APA reference list for all cited sources.",
