Brand Name\n2. Market Share Score (1-5, where 5 = dominant player)\n3. Innovation Score (1-5, where 5 = cutting-edge technology leader)\n4. Channel Power Score (1-5, where 5 = strongest sales/distribution)\n5. Brand Score (1-5, where 5 = strongest reputation/loyalty)\n6. Weighted Threat Score (calculated using weights: Market Share {{market_share_weight}}, Innovation {{innovation_weight}}, Channel Power {{channel_power_weight}}, Brand {{brand_weight}})\n7. Core USP (one sentence)\n8. Notable Strength (key advantage)\n9. Key Vulnerability (potential weakness to exploit)\n\n**SCORING GUIDELINES**\n- Use the competitor information from the PDF to justify each 1-5 score\n- Include the top 5 competitors identified in the market research\n- Calculate weighted scores as: (Market Share × {{market_share_weight}}) + (Innovation × {{innovation_weight}}) + (Channel Power × {{channel_power_weight}}) + (Brand × {{brand_weight}})\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**\n\nReturn the matrix in CSV format, followed by a brief analysis of the \"Boss Rival\" (highest weighted threat score) and top 2 strategic opportunities based on competitor vulnerabilities.",
