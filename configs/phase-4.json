Justify in ≤ 60 words.\n    * List three on-brand hashtags for the winning concept.\n    * End with a blank line, then output the winning concept's row from the table in Step 2 again for easy copy/paste.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nDocument (.docx) in this order:\n1️⃣ Need Selection paragraph → 2️⃣ Table of three concepts → 3️⃣ Scoring Rubrics paragraph → 4️⃣ **Rankings & Scoring** → 5️⃣ Recommendation paragraph\n\nAlso give me the entire output as a downloadable .docx file titled: \"Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx\"",
