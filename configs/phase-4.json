Phase 4 is where insight becomes invention: you will generate three concrete product or service concepts, score them across business criteria, and crown a single \"hero offer\" that your company will take to market.\n\nThe chosen concept—its code-name, feature set, and cost assumptions—feeds every downstream media-creation step, so precision here saves pain later.",

(This should influence code-names, value proposition language, and feature descriptions where applicable).\n* Acceptable BOM cost ≤ 50 % of retail price (i.e., ≤ $10 - $25 based on target retail).\n\n---\n\n**TASK**\n\n1.  **Need Selection**\n    * From the three `UNMET_NEEDS` provided, pick *one* that offers the highest strategic upside for {{phase1.company_name}}. Explain the choice in ≤ 50 words, citing relevant competitor matrix data and one key macro trend (from Phase 1 context).\n\n2.  **Generate Three Concepts**\n    * **Based on the need selected above, generate three distinct concepts.** For *each* concept, output in a table:\n        * Code-name (≤ 4 words, all caps)\n        * One-sentence value prop (start with a power verb)\n        * Key Features / Attributes (≤ 25 words)\n        * Primary materials/components\n        * Estimated BOM cost (USD, round to nearest dollar, respecting constraint)\n        * Competitive Advantage vs. highest-threat competitor(s) (≤ 15 words)\n\n3.  **Define Scoring Rubrics**\n    * Define and state clearly a 1-5 scoring rubric for Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential. Base definitions on standard business considerations and the context provided (e.g., Feasibility: 5=Uses existing tech/easy supply chain, 1=Requires new R&D/complex sourcing; Differentiation: 5=Highly unique/protected, 1=Me-too/easily copied; Margin Potential: 5=High perceived value/low BOM relative to price, 1=Price sensitive/high BOM relative to price).\n\n4.  **Score & Visualize** \n    * Using the rubrics above, score each concept (1-5) on Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential.\n    * Apply the `SCORING WEIGHTS` to calculate a final weighted score for each concept.\n    * Present results in two parts: a) Summary Rankings - List concepts in order by weighted score with brief rationale b) Detailed Scoring Matrix - Full breakdown table showing all scores and calculations.*\n\n5.  **Recommendation** \n    * Recommend ONE concept to advance based on the scoring and strategic fit. Justify in ≤ 60 words.\n    * List three on-brand hashtags for the winning concept.\n    * End with a blank line, then output the winning concept's row from the table in Step 2 again for easy copy/paste.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nDocument (.docx) in this order:\n1️⃣ Need Selection paragraph → 2️⃣ Table of three concepts → 3️⃣ Scoring Rubrics paragraph → 4️⃣ **Rankings & Scoring** → 5️⃣ Recommendation paragraph\n\nAlso give me the entire output as a downloadable .docx file titled: \"Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx\"",
