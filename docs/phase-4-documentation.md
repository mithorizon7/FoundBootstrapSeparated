## Decision Box Content

### Title: Concept Development Decisions
**Subtitle:** Strategic choices to guide your product concept generation

#### Section 1: Define Your Target Unmet Need

**Your Goal**
Identify the single most strategic unmet customer need that your product concepts will address. This should align with your core value proposition and market opportunity.

**Sources for Unmet Needs**
Draw from market research, customer interviews, competitive analysis, or strategic insights you've gathered. Look for problems that represent genuine market opportunities with clear customer pain points.

**How to Choose Your Unmet Need**
As a team, consider which customer problem offers the highest strategic potential. Evaluate:

• **Market Size**: How many customers face this problem?
• **Strategic Fit**: Does solving this align with your company's capabilities and vision?
• **Competitive Gap**: Are existing solutions inadequate or missing?
• **Customer Pain**: How significant is this problem for potential customers?

**Action: Prepare Your Unmet Need Statement**
Craft a clear, concise statement of the customer problem your concepts will solve.

**Example format:**

Parents struggle with complex tech toys and need simpler, more supportive solutions that genuinely deliver educational value without overwhelming complexity.

Prepare your unmet need statement for the form field above.

#### Section 2: Set Your Concept Scoring Weights

**Your Goal**
To decide how the AI should prioritize three critical factors when it evaluates the new product/service concepts it generates. These factors are:

• **Feasibility**: How easy or complex will it be to realistically develop and launch this concept? *(Considers technology, resources, supply chain)*
• **Differentiation**: How unique or distinct is this concept compared to what's already on the market? Does it offer a clear, novel advantage?
• **Margin Potential**: How strong is the potential for this concept to be profitable? *(Considers perceived value, pricing, and estimated cost of goods)*

**Your Task**
Decide on a percentage weight for each of these three factors. **The three percentages must add up to 100%.**

**Deciding Your Weights – Key Questions**
What's your venture's top priority right now?

• Quickly launching a viable product? *(Consider higher % for Feasibility)*
• Standing out with a truly novel offering? *(Consider higher % for Differentiation)*
• Ensuring strong profitability early on? *(Consider higher % for Margin Potential)*

**How AI Uses These Weights**
The AI will calculate a weighted score for each concept based on your percentages, helping you pick the most strategically aligned idea.

**Action**
Record your team's chosen percentages for Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential in the form fields above *(remember, they should equal 100%)*.

#### Section 3: Choose Brand Adjectives

**Selection Criteria**
Select **three (3) adjectives** that best capture the desired tone and feel for the new product/service concepts. These will help guide creative aspects like code-names and value propositions.

**Examples**
• Curious, Lively, Trustworthy
• Bold, Simple, Efficient
• Playful, Educational, Safe
• Premium, Discreet, Effective

**Action**
Choose the three specific adjectives you want to use in the form fields above.

### Action: Complete Form Fields
- Define your target unmet customer need
- Set your scoring weight percentages (must total 100%)
- Choose your three brand adjectives
- Fill in all form fields above before proceeding to the concept generation process
