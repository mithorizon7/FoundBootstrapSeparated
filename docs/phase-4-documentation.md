# Phase 4: Hero Offer Ideation

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

## Introduction

Welcome to Phase 4: Hero Offer Ideation. In this **15-minute sprint** you'll use ChatGPT (free) to turn a real market context into three sharply distinct product/service concepts, then see how an AI can score them against simple criteria and recommend a direction. You don't need to read the market report yourself—you'll upload it to ChatGPT so the model can ground its thinking while you focus on clear inputs and good decisions.

**The scenario you're working in: STEM Toys for Ages 4–8**

You're stepping into the roles of a brand-new STEM toy company's core team (product, design, operations, and marketing hats). Your job is to use ChatGPT to turn real market context into three distinct "hero offer" concepts—flagship ideas that could define the brand—then see how AI scores and recommends a direction using simple decision criteria.

## Decision Box Content

### Title: STEM Toy Market Context & Decisions
**Subtitle:** Understanding the market and making strategic choices for your STEM toy concepts

#### Section 1: Define Your Target Unmet Need

**Your Goal**
Identify the single most strategic unmet customer need that your product concepts will address. This should align with your core value proposition and market opportunity.

**Sources for Unmet Needs**
Draw from market research, customer interviews, competitive analysis, or strategic insights you've gathered. Look for problems that represent genuine market opportunities with clear customer pain points.

**How to Choose Your Unmet Need**
As a team, consider which customer problem offers the highest strategic potential. Evaluate:

• **Market Size**: How many customers face this problem?
• **Strategic Fit**: Does solving this align with your company's capabilities and vision?
• **Competitive Gap**: Are existing solutions inadequate or missing?
• **Customer Pain**: How significant is this problem for potential customers?

**Action: Prepare Your Unmet Need Statement**
Craft a clear, concise statement of the customer problem your concepts will solve.

**Example format:**

Parents struggle with complex tech toys and need simpler, more supportive solutions that genuinely deliver educational value without overwhelming complexity.

Prepare your unmet need statement for the form field above.

#### Section 2: Set Your Concept Scoring Weights

**Your Goal**
To decide how the AI should prioritize three critical factors when it evaluates the new product/service concepts it generates. These factors are:

• **Feasibility**: How easy or complex will it be to realistically develop and launch this concept? *(Considers technology, resources, supply chain)*
• **Differentiation**: How unique or distinct is this concept compared to what's already on the market? Does it offer a clear, novel advantage?
• **Margin Potential**: How strong is the potential for this concept to be profitable? *(Considers perceived value, pricing, and estimated cost of goods)*

**Your Task**
Decide on a percentage weight for each of these three factors. **The three percentages must add up to 100%.**

**Deciding Your Weights – Key Questions**
What's your venture's top priority right now?

• Quickly launching a viable product? *(Consider higher % for Feasibility)*
• Standing out with a truly novel offering? *(Consider higher % for Differentiation)*
• Ensuring strong profitability early on? *(Consider higher % for Margin Potential)*

**How AI Uses These Weights**
The AI will calculate a weighted score for each concept based on your percentages, helping you pick the most strategically aligned idea.

**Action**
Record your team's chosen percentages for Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential in the form fields above *(remember, they should equal 100%)*.

#### Section 3: Choose Brand Adjectives

**Selection Criteria**
Select **three (3) adjectives** that best capture the desired tone and feel for the new product/service concepts. These will help guide creative aspects like code-names and value propositions.

**Examples**
• Curious, Lively, Trustworthy
• Bold, Simple, Efficient
• Playful, Educational, Safe
• Premium, Discreet, Effective

**Action**
Choose the three specific adjectives you want to use in the form fields above.

### Action: Complete Form Fields
- Define your target unmet customer need
- Set your scoring weight percentages (must total 100%)
- Choose your three brand adjectives
- Fill in all form fields above before proceeding to the concept generation process
