## Documentation Structure

Each phase documentation includes:

- **Introduction** - Purpose and strategic context
- **Form Fields** - Complete field specifications with help text and tooltips
- **Decision Box Content** - Strategic guidance and decision frameworks
- **Step-by-Step Flow** - Detailed implementation instructions
- **Expected Output** - Deliverables and their strategic value
- **AI Prompt Templates** - Complete prompts for AI interactions

## Educational Design

### Atomized Activities
Each phase operates independently without cross-dependencies, enabling:
- Flexible completion order based on instructor needs
- Modular assignment of specific strategic skills
- Self-contained learning experiences

### Progressive Navigation
The platform implements progressive phase unlocking:
- Students only see phases they've accessed or been given links to
- Instructors maintain full navigation access
- Creates focused, non-overwhelming experience

### Individual Session Management
- Personal workspace codes for cross-device persistence
- Secure individual data isolation
- Admin oversight with participant progress tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence
All form data persists across sessions using localStorage with proper error handling and migration support.

### AI Integration
Each phase provides complete prompt templates for:
- Google Gemini (Deep Research, content generation)
- OpenAI ChatGPT (strategic analysis, concept development)  
- ElevenLabs (voice agent creation)
- Sora (image generation)
- Suno.ai (music creation)
- NotebookLM (podcast generation)

### Production Quality
- Comprehensive test coverage (99+ passing tests)
- Enterprise-grade security and validation
- Sub-400ms performance benchmarks
- Complete error handling and edge case management
