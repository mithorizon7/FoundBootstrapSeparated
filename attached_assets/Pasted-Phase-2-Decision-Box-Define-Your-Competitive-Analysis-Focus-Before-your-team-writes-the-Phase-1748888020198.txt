Phase 2 Decision Box üó≥Ô∏è: Define Your Competitive Analysis Focus 
Before your team writes the Phase 2 prompt for ChatGPT, you need to make two key decisions. These choices will shape the AI's research and analysis. Record your final choices to easily insert them into the prompt. 
1.	Define Your Company's Market Ambition:
o	Your Task: Write a single, clear sentence stating your company‚Äôs specific goal and target market. Think about what you want to achieve and who you want to serve. 
o	Why This Matters: A precise ambition helps the AI focus its analysis on the competitors and market segments that are most relevant to your potential new company. 
o	Example: {{COMPANY_NAME}}_AMBITION = "Targeting mid-market B2B SaaS customers in North America with a focus on ease-of-use and integration."
2.	Set Your Threat-Scoring Weights:
o	Your Task: Decide how important each of the following four factors is when evaluating how much of a threat a competitor poses in your specific market:
ÔÇß	Market Share
ÔÇß	Innovation
ÔÇß	Channel Power (i.e., their sales and distribution strength)
ÔÇß	Brand (i.e., their reputation and customer loyalty) Assign a numerical weight to each factor. 
o	How to Think About Weights:
ÔÇß	These weights reflect relative importance. A higher number means that factor will have a bigger influence on a competitor's overall "Threat Score."
ÔÇß	Ask yourselves: In our chosen market, what makes a competitor particularly challenging for a new entrant like us? Is it their existing customer base (Market Share), their cutting-edge technology (Innovation), their sales reach (Channel Power), or their strong name (Brand)? 
ÔÇß	Default Suggestion: You can start with equal weights (e.g., assign 0.25 to each, or simply 1 to each ‚Äì the AI will use these as relative values). 
ÔÇß	Custom Example: If you believe strong sales channels are twice as critical as brand recognition in your market, you might assign weights like: Market Share: 3, Innovation: 2.5, Channel Power: 3, Brand: 1.5. (Or, using decimals that sum to 1: Market Share: 0.30, Innovation: 0.25, Channel Power: 0.30, Brand: 0.15). The key is the ratio between the numbers.
o	Why This Matters: The AI will use these weights to calculate a "Weighted Threat Score" for each competitor, helping you identify who to watch out for and where opportunities might lie. (Note: The sum of your weights doesn't strictly have to be 1; the AI performs a simple weighted average regardless). 
‚û°Ô∏è Action: Once decided, write down:
‚Ä¢	Your final {{COMPANY_NAME}}_AMBITION statement.
‚Ä¢	Your chosen {{WEIGHTS}} for Market Share, Innovation, Channel Power, and Brand (e.g., Market Share: 0.3, Innovation: 0.3, Channel Power: 0.2, Brand: 0.2).
