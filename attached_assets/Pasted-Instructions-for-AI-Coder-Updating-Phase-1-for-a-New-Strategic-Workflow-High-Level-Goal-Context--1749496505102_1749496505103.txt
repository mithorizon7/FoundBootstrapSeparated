Instructions for AI Coder: Updating Phase 1 for a New Strategic Workflow

High-Level Goal & Context:

We are beginning a strategic refactor of the bootcamp's workflow. We are shifting from a "hypothesis-first" model (where users decide their core benefit before research) to a "discovery-driven" model (where users will use research to discover their core benefit).

Your first task is to update only Phase 1 to support this new direction. This involves two critical changes: replacing the prompt and updating the form fields to remove the now-obsolete "Core Benefit Keyword." This is the foundational first step that will enable downstream changes in later phases.

Your Detailed Instructions:

You will be editing a single file: FoundInTwo/configs/phase-1.json.

Action 1: Replace the Prompt Template

In phase-1.json, locate the promptTemplate key.
Replace its entire existing string value with the new prompt text that will be provided to you.
Action 2: Update the Phase 1 Form Fields

In the same file (phase-1.json), find the fields array.
Locate the entire object for the "Core Benefit Keyword" field (the one with an id of "benefit_keyword").
You must completely remove this object from the fields array.
Reasoning (For Your Context):
The new prompt is designed to be more open-ended and no longer uses a {{benefit_keyword}} variable. By removing this field from the Phase 1 form, we are aligning the UI with the new prompt and officially moving this strategic decision to Phase 2.

Constraint for This Task:

Do not make any changes to any other phase configuration files (e.g., phase-2.json, phase-4.json, etc.) at this time. This is a deliberate, step-by-step process, and further instructions will be provided for those files later.
Verification Checklist:

After your changes are complete, please verify the following:

When running the application, the "Prompt Preview" in Phase 1 correctly displays the new prompt text.
The user-facing form in Phase 1 no longer shows an input field for "Core Benefit Keyword."
This will successfully prepare Phase 1 for our new workflow.
