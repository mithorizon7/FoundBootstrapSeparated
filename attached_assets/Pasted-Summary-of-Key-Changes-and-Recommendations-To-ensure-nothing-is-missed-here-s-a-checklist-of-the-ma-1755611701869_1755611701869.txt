Summary of Key Changes and Recommendations
To ensure nothing is missed, here’s a checklist of the major adaptations we plan to implement:
Backend (General): Continue using the existing team-based logic for individuals. No major code refactor needed in business logic; just treat each team entry as an individual. Optionally refactor naming (teams -> participants) in code for clarity if time permits. Maintain the session-based authentication using codes and tokens (no user/password for participants).
Security Improvements: While not explicitly asked, we recommend a couple of light security enhancements when moving to individuals:
Make sure that sensitive operations (saving data, updating profile) require the user’s session. Add ensureAuthenticatedTeam where appropriate so one participant cannot accidentally (or maliciously) affect another’s data just by knowing an ID.
Encourage stronger or system-generated codes to reduce any chance of code guessing between participants.
Clearly instruct participants to keep their code private (since now it effectively acts as their login key).
User Experience Tweaks: Remove any multi-user phrasing or steps. Ensure the first thing a user sees is an invitation to start a new session or continue an existing one via code – this should be straightforward and welcoming, as these are professionals using the tool as part of a course. Possibly provide a short note like “No account needed – just remember your code to come back later!” to align expectations.
Avatar and Personalization: Keep the fun elements like avatars to maintain engagement. Possibly even allow users to edit their displayed name if needed (though if the name is their actual name, probably fine as set initially).
“Atomized” Sections Consideration: If the course content is reorganized such that sections can be done non-linearly, consider adjusting the progress model:
We might allow the UI to navigate sections out of order. In that case, the currentPhase field could be less of a gate and more of a record of last visited or highest completed phase. We could allow accessing any phase via URL or menu, but mark incomplete ones and require eventually that all are completed for a final submission.
The database could track completion of each phase via phaseData.completedAt timestamp
GitHub
, which we already store when markPhaseComplete is called. We could use that to know which sections are done.
This is a more complex change, so if not necessary, keeping the linear flow is fine. The phrase "sections are all atomized" might simply mean each section is independent content (which is fine; the platform doesn’t force interactions between sections except sequential order).
Testing: After these changes, thorough testing is needed:
Create a new session, go through a few phases, logout, and resume on another browser using the code to ensure data persists.
Test an admin logging in to see that the participant appears correctly in the cohort with accurate status.
Test avatar changes, project submission, and (if applicable) voting, to ensure those still work with one-person-per-team.
Verify that an admin can assign individuals to cohorts and that individuals can only see their own data.
Documentation: Update any README or help text in the app to reflect the new usage (e.g., if there was a guide saying “share this code with your teammates,” change it to “use this code to resume your session”). The codebase itself is well-commented; adding comments where we changed semantics (like “team = individual session in single-user mode”) will help future maintenance.
By following this plan, we retain the best parts of the core functionality:
Easy, account-free access with a simple code (carry over team code logic).
Persistent state and cross-device resume (leveraging access tokens and stored phase data).
Instructor oversight (cohort grouping, monitoring progress, viewing submissions).
Structured progress through phases or sections of the material.
Fun personalization (avatars, names) and engagement features like voting.
All of this is achieved with relatively small modifications to the existing code, thanks to the clean separation of concerns. The database and APIs don’t inherently care if a team has 5 people or 1 person – it’s just a record per code. We mainly adjust the front-end to treat that record as a single user context and adjust the wording.
Final Recommendations on Instructor Visibility/Admin
You expressed interest in keeping the admin features and possibly improving them. Here are a few focused suggestions for that:
Keep using the Admin Dashboard: It’s a valuable tool for you as an instructor to see everyone’s progress at a glance. We’ll adapt it to list individuals, but ensure it remains a central place to toggle any course-wide settings (like closing submissions when the deadline passes – controlled by submissionsOpen in cohort
GitHub
 – or showing results when ready, controlled by resultsVisible
GitHub
).
Adapt UI to Individuals: Small UI improvements like highlighting a participant row in red if they haven’t submitted but voting is about to close, etc., could be handy. These can be added using the data we have (hasSubmitted = false and maybe a date check).
Leverage Data for Interventions: Because you can see currentPhase (once we include it) for each participant, you can identify who is falling behind. We might even add a feature to send a nudge or message to those participants through the platform (though that’s a larger feature, possibly out-of-scope). At minimum, you can manually reach out if you see someone stuck on an early phase.
Simplify Admin Cohort Management: If many individuals enroll, giving each a code manually could be tedious. You might create a bunch of participant entries upfront or rely on them to self-register. If you self-register them, you could pre-generate codes and names (e.g., upload a list of names to auto-create entries). Currently, there’s no bulk import feature, but something to consider for convenience. Alternatively, for a large cohort, instruct participants to self-create but ensure codes are unique. The system will warn on duplicates
GitHub
, but you might want to suggest a format (like “use your first name or nickname as code” knowing duplicates might occur).
Future Improvement – Role-based Views: Now that “teams” are essentially individuals, the platform might in the future support a dual role login – participants (with just code) and instructors (with username/password). It already does, but they operate separately. You might consider adding the ability for an instructor to masquerade as a participant (for demonstration purposes or troubleshooting). This could be done by allowing admin to pick a participant from the list and “enter their view” (setting the session.teamId to that participant). This is advanced and would require some backend support (maybe a special admin endpoint to set session to a teamId, or simply providing the accessToken to the admin to use). It’s not necessary but can be useful if, say, a participant says “I have an issue on phase 2” – you could jump into their session to see exactly what they see. For now, you can always ask for their code and log in as them, which is essentially the same thing since no password on their side. That’s one advantage of the code system – even the instructor could use any code to view that session’s data if needed. Just keep that in mind (and be careful with it to respect privacy).
In conclusion, the transition to individual usage should be smooth. The system’s modular design (separating data, logic, and presentation) means we mostly adjust the presentation and slight parts of the logic, without overhauling the core. Individuals will get a seamless experience saving and resuming work across devices – exactly as teams did, but now tailored to a single user. Instructors will retain full visibility and control, with potential for even finer-grained monitoring. By implementing the plan above, the platform will “work great” for solo participants in your generative AI training courses, while still encapsulating the collaborative features (like sharing and voting) that can enrich the learning experience. Each of these changes can be implemented incrementally and tested, thanks to the clear separation in the code (e.g., update the schema/types, then storage, then routes, then front-end). We’ll proceed with these adaptations, ensuring to keep the best parts of the system intact and improving clarity and usability for the new context.
