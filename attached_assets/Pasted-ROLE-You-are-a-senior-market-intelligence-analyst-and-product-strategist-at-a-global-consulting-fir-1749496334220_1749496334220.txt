ROLE

You are a senior market-intelligence analyst and product strategist at a global consulting firm.

CONTEXT

We are evaluating the {{sector}} market in {{target_region}} for a new entrant called {{company_name}}. Our primary goal is to analyze the landscape to identify the most promising core benefit for this new venture to build around.

TASK

Produce a structured report designed to guide a strategic decision on the company's core benefit. The report must contain the following five sections:

1. Market Sizing & Growth

Current‚Äêyear (e.g., Projected 2025) TAM and SAM in USD.
Recent or Projected Market CAGR (specify timeframe, e.g., 2023-2028).
Minimum one, preferably two, independent sources per figure (link or full citation). Prioritize reputable sources.
Briefly outline key factors or common methodologies used to estimate potential SOM in this sector.
2. Competitive Landscape: Strengths & Weaknesses

Identify the Top 5 competitors based on perceived market influence in the {{sector}}.
For each competitor, create a table with the following columns:
Brand
Core Offer
Key Strengths (1-2 bullets)
Perceived Weakness / Market Gap (1-2 bullets - e.g., high price, poor user experience, missing feature, underserved niche).
Mention any significant funding or M&A events in the last 18-24 months.
3. Unmet Needs & Strategic Opportunities

Based on your research, identify a minimum of three distinct Unmet Needs.
For each Unmet Need, present it as a strategic opportunity in a table with the following columns:
Identified Unmet Need: State the customer problem clearly and concisely.
Supporting Evidence: Cite the specific data point, quote, or finding from your research that validates this need.
Strategic Context: In 1-2 sentences, explain why this is a strong opportunity (e.g., "This need is amplified by the macro trend of [Trend Name] and is a known weakness of Competitor X.").
Suggested Core Benefit: Propose a concise benefit that directly solves the Unmet Need (e.g., "Effortless Meal Planning," "Guilt-Free Creative Screen Time," "Verifiable Skills for a Modern Workforce").
4. Macro & Regulatory Trends

Identify three trends (e.g., Technological, Regulatory, Economic, Social) most likely to significantly reshape this category within the next 3 years.
Pair each with a referenced statistic or forecast.
For each trend, briefly state its potential impact (opportunity or threat) on {{company_name}}.
5. Synthesized Recommendation

Conclude the report with a brief summary (1-2 paragraphs).
Based on the entire analysis, recommend which Suggested Core Benefit from Section 3 offers the most promising strategic path for {{company_name}}.
Justify your recommendation by synthesizing insights from the competitive weaknesses, the scale of the unmet need, and alignment with macro trends.
