Phase 4: Part 2 - Finalizing Your Hero Concept & AI-Assisted Brief Generation 
You have now received the AI's initial output as a downloadable file named Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx. This file contains three potential product concepts. Your next steps are to:
1.	Review this file and select your team's "Hero Concept."
2.	Define a few key strategic inputs related to your chosen concept.
3.	Instruct ChatGPT to read Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx, plus your other foundational documents (Market_Competitors.pdf, competitor_matrix.csv ), and use your strategic inputs to create a comprehensive 'Hero Concept Detailed Brief'.
Step 1: Save Initial AI Output & Choose Your Hero Concept (Allocate 7-10 minutes)
•	Locate and Open: the Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx file that was generated by the AI in the first part of Phase 4. 
•	Review & Decide on Your Hero Concept:
o	As a team, thoroughly review the three concepts detailed in your saved Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx.
o	Discuss the AI's recommendation, individual concept details, and how each aligns with your company's goals and brand.
o	Crucial Decision 1: Select ONE concept to be your "Hero Concept." Note its exact Code-Name precisely as it appears in Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx. This is the most important decision for this step.
Step 2: Define Your Key Strategic Inputs (Allocate 3-5 minutes)
For the Hero Concept your team just selected in Step 1, you now need to define and explicitly state the following key inputs. These are your team's strategic decisions that the AI will use to refine the brief:
1.	Your Chosen Hero Concept Code-Name ({{CHOSEN_CONCEPT_CODE_NAME_BY_TEAM}}):
o	Write down the exact code-name for the concept you selected in Step 1.
2.	The Primary Unmet Need it Addresses ({{CHOSEN_CONCEPT_UNMET_NEED_BY_TEAM}}):
o	Refer to your team's original list of three unmet needs (from before the first Phase 4 prompt) and the AI's "Need Selection" rationale in Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx.
o	Decide and write down the specific unmet need statement that your chosen Hero Concept(s) most effectively solves.
3.	Specific Target Audience Description ({{CONCEPT_TARGET_AUDIENCE_BY_TEAM}}):
o	Write a brief 1-2 sentence description of the specific target audience for your chosen Hero Concept. This should be more targeted than your general company sector defined in Market_Competitors.pdf. (Make it so specific you could easily cast them in a movie. For instance:  "Parents of children aged 4-6 who prioritize screen-free, collaborative play and are looking to build their child's creative problem-solving skills.")
4.	Your Brand Adjectives ({{BRAND_ADJECTIVES_LIST_BY_TEAM}}):
o	List your team's three chosen brand adjectives (e.g., "Engaging, Intuitive, Trustworthy").
5.	Price Tier for this Concept ({{CONCEPT_PRICE_TIER_BY_TEAM}}):
o	State the price tier for this concept (e.g., "Mid-priced tier: (20–50 USD retail)").
Step 3: Generate Your Hero Concept Detailed Brief (Allocate 2 minutes for setup + AI Run Time)
•	Open a new chat in ChatGPT. Select the o3 model to use (this will likely take 1-2 minutes to generate).
•	Upload the following three documents to the chat:
1.	Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx (the file you saved in Step 1 of these instructions)
2.	Market_Competitors.pdf (your market research report from Phase 1)
3.	competitor_matrix.csv (your competitor analysis from Phase 2 – for general context if needed)
•	Once the files are uploaded, copy the entire "Phase 4 - Second Prompt (AI-Powered Brief with Document Extraction)" (provided below).
•	Carefully replace the five {{TEAM_DECISION_PLACEHOLDERS}} in that prompt with the specific information your team finalized in Step 2 above.
•	Submit the completed prompt to ChatGPT.
•	Review and Save: When ChatGPT generates the "Hero Concept Detailed Brief," review it carefully to ensure the AI correctly extracted and used the information for your chosen concept. Then copy the output into a document and save as: Hero_Concept_Detailed_Brief.docx.
 
Phase 4 - Second Prompt (AI-Powered Brief with Document Extraction)

Our team has analyzed the initial product concepts (detailed in the uploaded Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx) and has made the critical decision on which Hero Offer to advance. To ensure strategic alignment and gather all necessary context, we have also uploaded Market_Competitors.pdf (our foundational market research which includes our Company Name and Sector) and competitor_matrix.csv (our competitor analysis overview for background context).
