The Problem: What is happening?

On the Results.tsx page, when the winners are revealed, the point totals for each team animate, counting up from 0 to the final score. This animation is currently created using a JavaScript function called setInterval.

This is considered an imperative approach because the code gives the browser a step-by-step command: "every 50 milliseconds, add a little bit to the score, update the screen, and check if you're done."

Why is this a problem?

React is a declarative library. In React, we are meant to declare what the UI should look like based on the current state, and React handles the job of updating the screen efficiently.

Mixing the imperative setInterval with declarative React can lead to several subtle but frustrating bugs:

Memory Leaks: If the component re-renders for any reason, a new setInterval timer could be created without the old one being properly stopped. This can lead to multiple timers running simultaneously in the background, causing performance issues and unpredictable behavior.
Complexity: Managing these timers correctly requires careful use of the useEffect hook with cleanup functions, which can make the component's logic more complex and harder to maintain.
Lack of Control: Using a basic browser timer gives you less control over the animation's physics (like easing or spring effects) and makes it harder to coordinate with other animations on the page.
The Solution: Use a Declarative Animation Library

A much better and more "React-idiomatic" approach is to use a library designed for animations in React. The project already includes framer-motion, which is perfect for this.

Instead of manually calculating the score at each interval, you would simply tell framer-motion to animate a number from 0 to the final score, and the library would handle all the complex timing, updates, and cleanup for you.

File to Edit: FoundBootstrapShortened/client/src/pages/Results.tsx
Action:
Remove the animateScore function that uses setInterval.
Refactor the component that displays the score to use a <motion.span> or <motion.div> from framer-motion.
Use framer-motion's animate prop or its useAnimate hook to handle the number transition smoothly.
This approach is more robust, less prone to bugs, and aligns with modern React development practices, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
