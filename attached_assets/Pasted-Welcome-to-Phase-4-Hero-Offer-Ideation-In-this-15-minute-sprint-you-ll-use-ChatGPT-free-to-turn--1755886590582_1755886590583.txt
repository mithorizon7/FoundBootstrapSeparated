Welcome to Phase 4: Hero Offer Ideation. In this 15-minute sprint you’ll use ChatGPT (free) to turn a real market context into three sharply distinct product/service concepts, then see how an AI can score them against simple criteria and recommend a direction. You don’t need to read the market report yourself—you’ll upload it to ChatGPT so the model can ground its thinking while you focus on clear inputs and good decisions.

The scenario you’re working in: STEM Toys for Ages 4–8

You’re designing for families with children ages 4–8 in the U.S. STEM toys space. Think building sets, simple robotics, math & science kits, cause-and-effect toys, and playful learning accessories

Phase 4 · Hero Offer Ideation — STEM Toys (Ages 4–8)

You’re stepping into the roles of a brand-new STEM toy company’s core team (product, design, operations, and marketing hats). Your job in the next 15 minutes is to use ChatGPT (free) to turn a real market context into three sharply distinct “hero offer” concepts—flagship ideas that could define the brand—then see how AI scores and recommends a direction using simple decision lenses.

The scenario (what market you’re designing for)

You’re operating in the U.S. STEM toys market for children ages 4–8: building sets, beginner robotics, math & science kits, cause-and-effect play, and learning accessories. Buyers want hands-on learning that’s clearly explained, low-fuss setup (under 5 minutes, mess-light), and durable, reusable value at the price point they choose. Competition is crowded (including screens), so new offers need a clear “why us”. Safety and inclusion for young children are non-negotiable.

Market Unmet-Needs Brief (read this, then choose your focus)

Parents of 4–8-year-olds want hands-on, screen-light play that clearly builds early math and science skills—they’re skeptical of vague “STEM” claims and look for plain-language learning outcomes they can trust. A big barrier is adult friction: many kits are fussy to set up, messy, or assume the grown-up is a science teacher; families signal strong demand for start-in-under-5-minutes, repeatable activities, and step-by-step prompts that make non-expert adults feel confident. Value matters: buyers expect durability and reusability at their chosen price tier, and they respond well to progression paths (level-up challenges) that extend play without constant new purchases. Because the shelf is crowded—and screens compete for attention—new offers must present a clear “why us” (memorable benefit, safer experience, or easier routine) without sacrificing fun. Finally, because this audience is young, safety and inclusion (materials, small-parts risks, age-appropriate complexity, representation in instructions) are baseline expectations, not extras.

Your task now: From that brief, choose one unmet need to target (e.g., authentic learning with clear outcomes, low-fuss setup with parent confidence, or durable/reusable kits with level-up progression). Paste your choice into the prompt as UNMET_NEEDS, then proceed with the activity.
