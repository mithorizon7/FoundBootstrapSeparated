Phase 4 ‚ÄìDesign & Select the Hero Offer: ChatGPT Ideation: 
Up to now, you‚Äôve diagnosed the market (Phase 1), quantified the competition (Phase 2), and armed yourself with science based evidence (Phase 3). Phase 4 is where insight becomes invention: you will generate three concrete product or service concepts, score them across business criteria, and crown a single ‚Äúhero offer‚Äù that your company will take to market.
The chosen concept‚Äîits code-name, feature set, and cost assumptions‚Äîfeeds every downstream media-creation step, so precision here saves pain later.

Phase 4 PART 1 Decision Box üó≥Ô∏è ‚Äì Choices Before Running Phase 4 Part 1 Prompt
1. Select and Prepare Your Top 3 Unmet Needs:
1.	Your Goal: From your Phase 1 Market_Competitors.pdf, pinpoint three specific customer frustrations, market gaps, or unfulfilled desires that your new company, {{COMPANY_NAME}}, could realistically address with an innovative product.
2.	Look in Your Phase 1 Report ‚ÄúUnmet Needs‚Äù Section.
3.	How to Choose Your Top 3 Unmet Needs:
o	As a team, review the identified gaps, frustrations, or needs.
o	Discuss and select the three that offer the most strategic opportunity for your company. Consider:
1.	Alignment: Which needs best match your company's desired Kor Benefit/Value Add (your {{BENEFIT_KEYWORD}}) and overall vision?
2.	Impact: Which needs, if solved, would provide significant value to your target audience?
3.	Innovation Space: Which needs allow for a truly differentiated and innovative solution from your company?
4.	Action: Prepare the Unmet Needs Text for the Prompt:
o	The Phase 4 prompt will require you to paste in your three chosen unmet needs as concise points. You can copy, summarize, or adapt from your report. 
1.	For example: 
UNMET_NEEDS
* Parental Confidence Gap with Tech Toys
* Concerns about "STEM-washing" / Desire for Authentic Learning
2.	* High Cost vs. Play Longevity/Value

OR

UNMET_NEEDS
* Parents struggle with complex tech toys and need simpler, more supportive solutions.
* Desire for toys that genuinely deliver on educational promises without "STEM-washing."
* Need for durable toys that offer long-lasting play value relative to their cost.
o	Have the exact text for your three chosen unmet needs (preferably as bullet points) ready to paste into the {{UNMET_NEEDS}} section of the Phase 4 prompt.
Set Your Concept Scoring Weights:
‚Ä¢	Your Goal: To decide how the AI should prioritize three critical factors when it evaluates the new product/service concepts it generates. These factors are:
o	Feasibility: How easy or complex will it be to realistically develop and launch this concept? (Considers technology, resources, supply chain.)
o	Differentiation: How unique or distinct is this concept compared to what's already on the market? Does it offer a clear, novel advantage?
o	Margin Potential: How strong is the potential for this concept to be profitable? (Considers perceived value, pricing, and estimated cost of goods.) 
‚Ä¢	 Your Task: Decide on a percentage weight for each of these three factors. The three percentages must add up to 100%.
o	Deciding Your Weights ‚Äì Key Questions: What's your venture's top priority right now?
o	Quickly launching a viable product? (Consider higher % for Feasibility)
o	Standing out with a truly novel offering? (Consider higher % for Differentiation)
o	Ensuring strong profitability early on? (Consider higher % for Margin Potential)
‚Ä¢	How AI Uses These Weights: The AI will calculate a weighted score for each concept based on your percentages, helping you pick the most strategically aligned idea.
‚Ä¢	Action: Record your team's chosen percentages for {{F%}} (Feasibility), {{D%}} (Differentiation), and {{M%}} (Margin Potential) for the Phase 4 prompt. (remember, they should equal 100%).
5.	Choose Brand Adjectives:
o	Select three (3) adjectives that best capture the desired tone and feel for the new product/service concepts. These will help guide creative aspects like code-names and value propositions.
o	Examples: Curious, Lively, Trustworthy; Bold, Simple, Efficient; Playful, Educational, Safe; Premium, Discreet, Effective.
o	(Action: Choose the three specific adjectives you want to use for {{ADJ1}}, {{ADJ2}}, and {{ADJ3}} in the prompt.)
6.	Prepare for Prompt:
o	Gather your selected Unmet Needs text, the decided Scoring Weight percentages, and your chosen Brand Adjectives. You will insert these directly into the corresponding {{PLACEHOLDERS}} in the Phase 4 prompt template before submitting it to the AI.

Phase 4 Prompt 1
**ROLE**
You are the lead innovation architect for {{COMPANY_NAME}}, tasked with designing a breakout offering.

**INPUT FILES**
* CSV/Excel: `competitor_matrix.csv`
* Text block: UNMET_NEEDS

UNMET_NEEDS
{{Paste the 3 circled unmet-need bullets here}}

**SCORING WEIGHTS**
Feasibility {{F%}}, Differentiation {{D%}}, Margin Potential {{M%}} (total 100%).

**CONSTRAINTS**
* Price Tier: Mid (20‚Äì50 USD retail).
* Must undercut or neutralize the key vulnerability of the **highest-scoring threat competitor(s)** identified in the Excel/CSV matrix.
* Align concepts with these brand adjectives: **{{ADJ1}}, {{ADJ2}}, {{ADJ3}}**. (This should influence code-names, value proposition language, and feature descriptions where applicable).
* Acceptable BOM cost ‚â§ 50 % of retail price (i.e., ‚â§ $10 - $25 based on target retail).

**TASK**

1.  **Need Selection**
    * From the three `UNMET_NEEDS` provided, pick *one* that offers the highest strategic upside for {{COMPANY_NAME}}. Explain the choice in ‚â§ 50 words, citing relevant competitor matrix data and one key macro trend (from Phase 1 context).

2.  **Generate Three Concepts**
    * **Based on the need selected above, generate three distinct concepts.** For *each* concept, output in a table:
        * Code-name (‚â§ 4 words, all caps)
        * One-sentence value prop (start with a power verb)
        * Key Features / Attributes (‚â§ 25 words)
        * Primary materials/components
        * Estimated BOM cost (USD, round to nearest dollar, respecting constraint)
        * Competitive Advantage vs. highest-threat competitor(s) (‚â§ 15 words)

3.  **Define Scoring Rubrics**
    * Define and state clearly a 1-5 scoring rubric for Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential. Base definitions on standard business considerations and the context provided (e.g., Feasibility: 5=Uses existing tech/easy supply chain, 1=Requires new R&D/complex sourcing; Differentiation: 5=Highly unique/protected, 1=Me-too/easily copied; Margin Potential: 5=High perceived value/low BOM relative to price, 1=Price sensitive/high BOM relative to price).

4.  **Score & Visualize** 
    * Using the rubrics above, score each concept (1-5) on Feasibility, Differentiation, and Margin Potential.
    * Apply the `SCORING WEIGHTS` to calculate a final weighted score for each concept.
    * Present results in two parts: a) Summary Rankings - List concepts in order by weighted score with brief rationale b) Detailed Scoring Matrix - Full breakdown table showing all scores and calculations.*

5.  **Recommendation** 
    * Recommend ONE concept to advance based on the scoring and strategic fit. Justify in ‚â§ 60 words.
    * List three on-brand hashtags for the winning concept.
    * End with a blank line, then output the winning concept's row from the table in Step 2 again for easy copy/paste.
