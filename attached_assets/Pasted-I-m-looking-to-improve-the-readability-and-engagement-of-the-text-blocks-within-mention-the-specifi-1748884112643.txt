I'm looking to improve the readability and engagement of the text blocks within [mention the specific section, e.g., "the Step-by-Step Workflow" or "the AI Prompt Preview text"]. Right now, they're a bit dense, and I think some strategic typographic emphasis could really help guide the user's eye and highlight crucial information.

Here are some ideas on what we could emphasize and how:

Highlighting Key Actions/Verbs:

For instance, in the workflow steps, words like "Open," "Copy," "Submit," "Select," "Press," "Rename," "Download" could be bolded to make the primary action of each step immediately clear.
Emphasizing Specific Terms/Options/Inputs:

Names of tools, options, or specific text the user needs to interact with, like "Deep Research" option, "Market_Competitors" (for the filename), or placeholders like {{company_name}} in the AI prompt preview could be styled. Perhaps bold or a subtle accent color (ensuring good contrast).
For example, in Step 1: "Open Gemini (...) and in the chat box select the “Deep Research” option."
In Step 6: "...rename the file "Market_Competitors" and download it as a PDF."
Drawing Attention to Important Notes or Values:

Things like time estimates (e.g., "4-9 minutes") or crucial instructions could stand out. Maybe this is where a different color (again, high contrast and not the sole indicator) or italics could be used judiciously.
Improving Scannability of Lists or Sequential Actions within a Block:

If a single step involves multiple sub-actions (like in Step 3: "...begin searching, analyzing, and synthesizing information..."), bolding these key processes might help.
Things to Consider:

Consistency: Let's aim for a consistent approach across all similar text blocks.
Balance: We want to avoid overdoing it. The goal is clarity, not a visual cacophony.
Accessibility: Please ensure any color usage is accessible (good contrast ratios) and not the only means of conveying information.
Could you propose a few ways we could implement this, perhaps starting with one or two of the workflow steps as an example? I'm open to your suggestions on whether bold, italics, color, or a combination works best within our existing design language.
