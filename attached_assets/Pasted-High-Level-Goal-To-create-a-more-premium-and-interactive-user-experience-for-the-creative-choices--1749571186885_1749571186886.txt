High-Level Goal:

To create a more premium and interactive user experience for the creative choices in Phase 6, we will replace the standard dropdown menus for visual_style and voice_persona with a custom "Selection Card" component.

Implementation Plan:

Create a New Component:

Create a new, reusable component named something like SelectionCard.tsx.
This component will accept props like title, description, isSelected, and onClick.
It should be styled as a Card from shadcn/ui and should visually change when isSelected is true (e.g., by changing its border color to hsl(var(--primary))).
Modify PhasePage.tsx:

In the section that renders the form fields for Phase 6, instead of looping and rendering a <Field> component for visual_style and voice_persona, you will manually render a group of your new <SelectionCard /> components.
You will map over the options array from phase-6.json for each field.
The onClick handler for each card will call handleFieldChange to update the form's state with the selected value (e.g., handleFieldChange('visual_style', 'Clean & Minimalist')).
The isSelected prop will be true if the current form state for that field matches the card's value.
This approach will deliver a significantly more sophisticated and user-friendly experience, making the "Creative Brief" portion of Phase 6 a highlight of the bootcamp.

The current plan is to present the detailed guidance in the decisionBoxContent, and then have the user select from a simple dropdown menu in the form. The "best-in-class" evolution of this is to merge the guidance and the choice into a single, interactive experience.

The Premium Approach: Interactive Selection Cards

Instead of using dropdown menus for Visual Style and Voice Persona, we can present these options as a set of visually rich, clickable cards.

Imagine this user experience for choosing a "Visual Style":

The user sees a beautifully laid-out row of five cards.
Each card has a title (e.g., "Clean & Minimalist"), a representative icon, and the full description ("Conveys sophistication, order, and expertise...").
Instead of reading text and then finding the corresponding option in a dropdown, the user simply clicks directly on the card that best represents their brand.
The selected card gets a highlighted border and a checkmark, providing clear visual feedback of their choice.
Why This Approach is More Premium

Visually Engaging: It transforms a standard form into a more pleasant, gallery-like experience. It's more enjoyable to interact with.
Reduces Cognitive Load: All information is presented upfront. The user can easily compare the different archetypes side-by-side without having to open and close a dropdown menu repeatedly.
Reinforces Importance: Presenting these strategic choices as thoughtfully designed cards, rather than simple list items, communicates their importance to the user. It makes the decision feel more significant.
Feels Modern and Custom: This is the kind of polished interaction users expect from a top-tier application.
