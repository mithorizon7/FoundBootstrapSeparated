The current design of the Found-In-Two Market Research page is looking really sharp and clean – fantastic work on the structure and clarity so far!
I'd like us to now focus on pushing it to the next level: transforming it into a truly top-tier, consumer-ready product with an exceptionally polished feel. This means refining the details that contribute to a premium user experience, making it intuitive, responsive, and visually delightful.
Here are some areas I'd like us to explore and refine:
1. Enhancing Visual Sophistication & Micro-interactions:
Interactive Element Feedback:

Buttons (e.g., "Copy Prompt," "Team v" dropdown): Let's ensure hover, active/pressed, focus, and even disabled states are distinct, elegant, and provide satisfying visual feedback. Consider subtle animations (e.g., a slight lift or color transition) on hover/press.
Input Fields ("Decision Box"): Refine focus states. Can we add a subtle border highlight, a change in label color, or a very gentle shadow to indicate an active field? Ensure validation states (success/error) are also visually clear and elegant.
"Step-by-Step Workflow" Numbers: While functional, could these numbered circles have a more refined hover/active state if they become interactive, or perhaps a subtle animation as the user scrolls past or completes a conceptual stage?

Smooth Transitions & Animations:

"AI Prompt Preview" Updates: As the user types in the "Decision Box," the "Live Preview" should update seamlessly. Let's ensure this transition is smooth, perhaps with a subtle fade-in/out for updated text elements if appropriate, to avoid any jarring content shifts.
Loading States/Progress: The main "Phase 1 of 7 - 12 minutes" progress bar is good. If any other part of the UI has micro-loading states (e.g., fetching team members in the dropdown), ensure these are handled with elegant spinners or shimmer effects rather than abrupt changes.

Depth and Layering:

Review the use of shadows and borders. Can we use subtle, nuanced shadows (e.g., on the "Decision Box" and "AI Prompt Preview" cards, or the main header) to create a clearer sense of depth and hierarchy without appearing heavy?

Iconography:

Ensure all icons (e.g., in the "Team v" dropdown, any potential icons for the steps) are pixel-perfect, consistently styled, and feel custom-made for a premium product.

Visual Polish on Text Elements:

Can we introduce any subtle typographic enhancements? For instance, ensure perfect vertical rhythm and spacing. Perhaps a slightly different weight or subtle color for placeholder text in input fields versus user-entered text.

2. Optimizing Information Hierarchy & Readability:
"Step-by-Step Workflow" Text Blocks: While the content is clear, the text is quite dense. Could we explore:

Slightly increasing line height or paragraph spacing for better scannability?
Using font weights or subtle color differences to emphasize key actions or instructions within each step?

"AI Prompt Preview" Clarity:

The {{variables}} are clear. Could we further enhance the link between the "Decision Box" inputs and these placeholders in the preview? Perhaps a very subtle highlight on the corresponding variable in the preview when a field in the "Decision Box" is focused.

Overall Spacing & Alignment (Pixel Perfection):

A meticulous review of all spacing and alignment. Consistent padding, margins, and distribution of elements contribute significantly to a polished feel. Let's aim for pixel-perfect consistency.

3. Enhancing Overall "Feel" & Professionalism:

Responsiveness & Performance: The UI should feel incredibly snappy and responsive. Any perceived lag will detract from the premium experience.
Accessibility (WCAG AA as a minimum): Ensure strong color contrast, full keyboard navigability, and proper ARIA attributes. A top-tier product is accessible to all.
Empty/Initial States: How do the "Decision Box" and "AI Prompt Preview" look before any user input? These states should be thoughtfully designed, perhaps with guiding text or subtle visuals.
"Auto-saving" Feedback: The current indicator is good. Ensure any other status messages (e.g., "Copied to clipboard") are equally well-integrated, non-intrusive, and elegantly styled.

For inspiration, as we refine these details, we might look at:

Linear.app for their exceptional attention to micro-interactions and subtle animations
Notion for their approach to making complex interfaces feel intuitive
Figma for how they handle real-time updates and collaborative features
Raycast for delightful details that make the product feel premium

The goal here is to move from "very good" to "exceptional." It's often the accumulation of these small, thoughtful refinements that creates that truly premium product feel – where users think "wow, this feels great to use" without necessarily being able to pinpoint why.
Please let me know your thoughts, and if you have any ideas or best practices you'd recommend for achieving this level of polish. I'm happy to discuss any of these points in more detail or provide more specific examples if helpful.
Thanks so much for your continued excellent work on this!
