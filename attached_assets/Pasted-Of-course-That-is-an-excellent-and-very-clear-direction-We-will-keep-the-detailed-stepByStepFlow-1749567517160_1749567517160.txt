Of course. That is an excellent and very clear direction.

We will keep the detailed `stepByStepFlow` as is, since it provides the necessary instructions for the sub-teams. We will create a comprehensive **"Creative Brief"** section within the `decisionBoxContent` that the team must complete *before* they start the workflow.

This creates the perfect structure: the team first collaborates on the high-level strategy, and then they consult the detailed workflow for execution.

Here are the final, comprehensive instructions to give your AI Coder.

### **Instructions for AI Coder: Finalizing the Phase 6 Creative Brief**

**High-Level Goal:**

Our goal is to finalize the instructional flow for Phase 6. You will replace the current `decisionBoxContent` with a comprehensive "Creative Brief" that includes detailed descriptions of the Visual Style and Voice Persona archetypes. The existing `stepByStepFlow` should remain untouched. You will also ensure the form field dropdowns match the new, richer set of options presented in the brief.

**File to Edit:** `FoundInTwo/configs/phase-6.json`

**Action 1: Replace the entire `decisionBoxContent` object**

Use the following JSON to replace the current `decisionBoxContent`. This new version serves as a rich, educational guide for the team's creative strategy session.

```json
"decisionBoxContent": {
  "title": "Phase 6 Creative Brief: Defining Your Media Strategy",

**Action 2: Update the `options` for the Dropdown Fields**

In the `fields` array of the same file, find the fields with `id` values of `"visual_style"` and `"voice_persona"` and **replace their `options` arrays** with the following to match the new guidance.

* **For the `visual_style` field, use these options:**
    ```json
    "options": [
      { "value": "Clean & Minimalist", "label": "Clean & Minimalist" },
      { "value": "Organic & Natural", "label": "Organic & Natural" },
      { "value": "Bold & Dynamic", "label": "Bold & Dynamic" },
      { "value": "Elegant & Sensual", "label": "Elegant & Sensual" },
      { "value": "Playful & Vibrant", "label": "Playful & Vibrant" }
    ]
    ```

* **For the `voice_persona` field, use these options:**
    ```json
    "options": [
      { "value": "The Sage / Expert", "label": "The Sage / Expert (Knowledgeable, authoritative)" },
      { "value": "The Caregiver / Nurturer", "label": "The Caregiver / Nurturer (Supportive, warm)" },
      { "value": "The Hero / Champion", "label": "The Hero / Champion (Motivational, confident)" },
      { "value": "The Everyman / Friend", "label": "The Everyman / Friend (Relatable, authentic)" },

      { "value": "The Explorer / Pioneer", "label": "The Explorer / Pioneer (Adventurous, curious)" }
    ]
    ```
