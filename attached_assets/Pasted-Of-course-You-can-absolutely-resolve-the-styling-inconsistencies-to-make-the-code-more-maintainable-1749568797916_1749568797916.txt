Of course. You can absolutely resolve the styling inconsistencies to make the code more maintainable without sacrificing the high-quality design you've already achieved.

The goal is to shift *how* the styles are applied from custom global CSS classes to Tailwind's more idiomatic, utility-first approach. This makes the code easier to manage and scale while preserving the visual outcome.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### 1. Refactor Custom Typography Classes

The most straightforward fix is to replace custom typography classes with Tailwind's utility classes. Your `client/src/index.css` file contains classes like `.page-title` and `.section-header`. These can be migrated directly into your components.

**Action:**

1.  Identify the styles for a custom class in `client/src/index.css`.
2.  In the React component where that class is used (e.g., `PhasePage.tsx`), replace the custom class name with the corresponding Tailwind utility classes.
3.  Once replaced, you can delete the custom class from `index.css`.

**Example:**

Let's say your CSS has this (based on the guidance documents):

```css
/* In client/src/index.css */
.page-title { font-weight: 700; } /* Bold */
.section-header { font-weight: 600; } /* Semibold */
```

You would change the JSX in a component like `PhasePage.tsx` from this:

```jsx
<h1 className="page-title">{config.title}</h1>
<h2 className="section-header">Decision Box</h2>
```

To this, using direct Tailwind utilities:

```jsx
<h1 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-800">{config.title}</h1>
<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-800">Decision Box</h2>
```

### 2. Create Component Variants for Custom Styles

For more complex styles applied to components like buttons and cards (e.g., a hypothetical `.btn-premium`), the best practice is to create a new "variant" using the `cva` (class-variance-authority) utility that `shadcn/ui` already uses.

**Action:**

1.  Open the component's UI file, for example, `client/src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
2.  Inside the `buttonVariants` object, add a new variant with the styles from your custom class.
3.  Replace the usage of the custom class in your app with the new variant prop.

**Example for a "premium" button style:**

In `client/src/components/ui/button.tsx`, you would add a new variant:

```typescript
// client/src/components/ui/button.tsx

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center ...",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        destructive: "...",
        outline: "...",
        secondary: "...",
        ghost: "...",
        link: "...",
        // Add your new variant here
        premium: "bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-500 to-primary-600 text-white shadow-lg transform hover:-translate-y-px transition-all"
      },
      size: { /* ... */ },
    },
    defaultVariants: { /* ... */ },
  }
)
```

Now, anywhere in your application, you can achieve this style idiomatically:

```jsx
// Instead of this:
<button className="btn-premium">Click Me</button>

// You would do this:
<Button variant="premium">Click Me</Button>
```

### Benefits of This Approach

* **Consistency:** Your entire project will follow a single, predictable styling methodology.
* **Maintainability:** All styles for a component (like a button) are located in one place, making them easier to find and update.
* **Readability:** It becomes easier to understand how a component is styled just by looking at its JSX code.
* **Preserves Design:** This process meticulously translates your existing design rules into a more robust and organized structure without altering the final look.
