Phase 3 – Background Research: OpenAI Deep-Research
Compelling strategy needs credible proof. Investors & customers will ask “Why should customers believe your claim?”
In this phase you’ll commission OpenAI’s Deep-Research engine to compile a tightly-sourced dossier of peer-reviewed findings that validate your core benefit (e.g., play-driven learning, AI-assisted wellness). The resulting PDF will:
•	Fuel the authority of your marketing copy, podcast, and voice agent
•	Supply headline statistics and inform the creation of other communications assets
•	Provide citations savvy stakeholders can audit
 
 
Decision Box 🗳️ – Pre-prompt Choices
1.	Evidence horizon – How recent must studies be?
Default: last 10 years. (You may tighten to 5 years for fast-moving tech sectors.)
2.	Tone for pull-quotes – Choose either academic gravitas or relatable practitioner.
3.	Preferred statistic style – Percentages vs. absolute gains (helps later headline selection).
Write your three choices; you will paste them into the prompt.
