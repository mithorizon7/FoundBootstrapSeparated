1. The Overall Goal (The "Why")

The primary goal is to improve the readability and visual hierarchy of our instructional text blocks, like the one in the Phase 5 intro. Right now, they are dense blocks of plain text.

We want to transform them into a scannable, at-a-glance guide where users can instantly identify the most important information. The desired outcome is a more polished, professional, and intuitive user experience that reduces cognitive load.

2. Key Information to Emphasize (The "What")

Within this text, there are different tiers of information. Your task is to create a clear visual distinction between them. Here are the elements to focus on, in order of importance:

Primary Actions & Deliverables (Most Important): The user's eye should be drawn here first.

The core verbs that start each step: Review, select, Define, Instruct.
The specific filenames or artifacts they will interact with: Phase_4_Offer_Concepts.docx and 'Hero Concept Detailed Brief'.
Key Concepts (Secondary Importance): These are the central strategic terms of the phase. They should stand out from normal text but be secondary to the primary actions.

For example: 'Hero Concept' and 'strategic inputs'.
Structural Elements: The numbered list format itself should be clear and easy to follow.

3. Creative Latitude & Suggested Methods (The "How")

We trust your design expertise to find the best solution. Please feel free to explore any of these methods to achieve the goal:

Typographic Variation: Using different font weights (e.g., bold, semibold) is a great way to create hierarchy.
Color: We could sparingly use our primary brand color to highlight the single most important term, like 'Hero Concept'.
Styling for Artifacts: Filenames could have a unique style to make them feel like tangible objectsâ€”perhaps a <code> tag style, a different font color, or a subtle background highlight.
Layout and Spacing: Feel free to adjust the spacing, indentation, or styling of the numbered list to make the sequence of tasks clearer.
